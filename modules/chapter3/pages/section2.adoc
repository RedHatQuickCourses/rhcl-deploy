== Create Auth Policy

In this lab, you set a **default, deny-all AuthPolicy to start with zero-trust** for your Gateway, ensuring no traffic is allowed unless explicitly permitted, and verifies its acceptance by the Connectivity Link controller.

* Set a **default, deny-all AuthPolicy** for your Gateway means that the Gateway will reject all incoming requests by default unless a specific authorization rule allows them.
This policy enforces strict access control, ensuring that no traffic is unintentionally permitted.

** Execute below yaml setting by running the following command:
+

**oc apply -f -<<EOF

Note the **Status** is set to **Accepted(not Enforced)** as there is no route to enforce the policy.
