== Create TLS Policy

In this lab, you will set a TLSPolicy for your Gateway to manage secure traffic, and verifying its acceptance by the Kuadrant controller.

* Set the **TLSPolicy** for your Gateway by running the following command:
+
[subs="+quotes,+macros"]
----
[lab-user@bastion ~]$ **curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RedHatQuickCourses/rhcl-qc-apps/refs/heads/main/kuadrant-tlspolicy.yaml | envsubst | oc apply -f -**
tlspolicy.kuadrant.io/external-tls created
----

* Verify that the TLS policy has been accepted by the controller:
+
[subs="+quotes,+macros"]
----
[lab-user@bastion ~]$ **oc get tlspolicy ${gatewayName}-tls -n ${gatewayNS} -o=jsonpath='{.status.conditions[?(@.type=="Accepted")].message}'**
TLSPolicy has been accepted
----

* Navigate to the Red Hat Openshift console and select **Operators** -> select **Installed Opertor** -> select **Kuadrant Operator** -> select **TLSPolicy** -> select **external-tls** and notice the **Conditions** section:

Note that the **Enforced** status is set to **False** as certificate **api-external-tls** is not ready.
