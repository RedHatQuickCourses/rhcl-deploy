== Create DNS Policy

Now that we have setup a secure, protected application connectivity environment, we are now ready to expose this to the Internet. We will do so by creating a DNSPolicy.

In this lab, you set a **DNSPolicy** for your Gateway, using the previously defined DNS provider secret, and verify its acceptance by the Connectivity Link controller.

* Configure the **DNSPolicy** for your Gateway by running the following command:
+
====
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
**oc apply -f -<<EOF
apiVersion: kuadrant.io/v1
kind: DNSPolicy
metadata:
 name: external-dnspolicy
 namespace: api-gateway
spec:
 targetRef:
   name: external
   group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
   kind: Gateway
 providerRefs:
 - name: aws-credentials
EOF**
----
====
+
You should see the output as follows:
+
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
dnspolicy.kuadrant.io/external-dnspolicy created
----

* Navigate to the Red Hat Openshift console and select **Kuadrant** -> select **Overview** -> notice the **Policy** section's **external-dnspolicy** option:

Note the **Status** for **external-dnspolicy** is set to **Enforced**.
