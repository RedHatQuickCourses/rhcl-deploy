== Summary

In this chapter, we configured essential components and policies for managing API traffic in the Kuadrant API Gateway:

* DNS and TLS Setup: Established AWS credentials, created Kubernetes secrets, and secured communication with Let's Encrypt TLS certificates.
* Auth Policy: Implemented a deny-all AuthPolicy for a zero-trust security baseline, ensuring no traffic is allowed without explicit permission.
* TLS Policy: Configured a TLSPolicy to enforce secure traffic on the Gateway.
* Rate Limit Policy: Set up a RateLimitPolicy to control API traffic and prevent overloads.
* DNS Policy: Established a DNSPolicy to expose the secure application to the Internet using a pre-configured DNS provider.

This chapter has equipped the platform with robust security configurations for efficient API traffic management.

In the next section, we will deploy a sample **toystore** application and configure external access through an HTTPRoute, applying Connectivity Link policies for authentication and access control.
