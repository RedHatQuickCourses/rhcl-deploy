= Lab Scenerio

Before we dive into the lab, let’s review the following scenario:

== Situation

Globex, a fast-growing retail company, is expanding its mobile presence by allowing access to its core services via a new mobile app.
However, security is a top priority, as exposing their core service endpoints to unauthorized access could pose significant risks.

To address these concerns, _Globex_ has decided to:

* Implement OpenID Connect (OIDC) for secure authentication to the _Product Catalog API_.

Additionally, _Globex_ aims to protect its endpoints by:

* Implementing rate limiting
* Enforcing user-specific access controls

Their goals include:

* Managing everything through configuration
* Avoiding hardcoding
* Easily adjusting rate limits as needed

== Solution to the Situation along with in-depth Architecture

_Globex’s_ development team has built a Mobile Gateway, serving as a single point of entry (a wrapper) in front of the company’s core services, following the gateway-pattern approach. This gateway allows Globex’s mobile app to access core services, but the endpoint must be secured for safe connectivity.

To enhance security and management:
* _Globex_ adopts a policy-as-code approach allowing them to define security through code for automated and repeatable processes.

* _Globex_ adopts a Kubernetes-native approach to application connectivity using Red Hat Connectivity Link (RHCL).
* RHCL enables secure, efficient management of application connectivity across both single and multi-cluster environments.
* Using RHCL, _Globex_  integrates Gateway API and policies, enabling them to effectively scale, load-balance, and secure their gateways.


== What We Will Do in This Lab-Oriented Course

In the upcoming sections, we will exercise these concepts by dividing the work into two job roles:

* Platform Engineer
** The Platform Engineer sets up a Gateway to establish secure connections to backend service endpoints.
** This process involves configuring several other components as well. Navigate to this section to learn more.

* Developer
** Once the Gateway is established, developers will onboard their service endpoints by creating an HTTPRoute for each endpoint.
** Developers can also override the authentication and rate limit policies set by the Platform Engineer to address their specific authorization needs and non-functional rate limiting requirements.
