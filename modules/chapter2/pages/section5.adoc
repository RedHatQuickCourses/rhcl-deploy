== Summary

This chapter has laid the groundwork for API management in a Red Hat Openshift environment by:

* Setting up managed zone using AWS Route53
* Install and configure Istio with Sail Operator
* Install Kuadrant operator
* Deploy Kuadrant instance

All these will support traffic control, security, and scalability in the upcoming chapters.

In the next section, as a Platform Engineer, youâ€™ll configure:

* DNS and TLS for the Kuadrant API Gateway
* Implement policies like DNS, TLS, Authentication, and Rate Limiting to manage API traffic effectively
