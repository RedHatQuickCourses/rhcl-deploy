== Introduction

Welcome to this quick course on the _Getting Started with Red Hat Connectivity Link_.
This course is the `second` in a series of `two` courses about Red Hat Connectivity Link.

In this hands-on lab, you will learn how to secure, protect, and connect an API through a Gateway based on the Kubernetes Gateway API, all within a single OpenShift cluster with a shared HTTPS listener. 

This lab is designed to use Red Hat Connectivity Link (RHCL) with a specific use case to implement its features, focusing on two different user roles:

* **Platform Engineer**: As a Platform Engineer, this lab will guide you through deploying a Gateway that ensures secure communication, making it ready for application development teams. You'll learn to route specific traffic while maintaining security through global rate limiting and authentication.

* **Application Developer**: As an Application Developer, this lab will show you how to deploy your application API and override the Gateway's global authentication and rate limiting policies to tailor them to your applicationâ€™s specific needs.
Overall, this lab demonstrates how both platform engineers and application developers can effectively leverage RHCL to achieve their goals.
