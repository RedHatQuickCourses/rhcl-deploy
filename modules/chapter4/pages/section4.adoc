== Create HTTP Route

This lab guides you through the process of setting up and verifying an HTTPRoute for your Gateway,
enforcing DNSPolicy and other policies, ensuring that the connection is secure and functioning as expected.

* Create an **HTTPRoute** for your Gateway by running the following command:
+
====
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
**oc apply -f -<<EOF
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: HTTPRoute
metadata:
 name: toystore
 namespace: toystore
spec:
 hostnames:
   - toystore.managed.<sandboxXXXX.opentlc.com>
 parentRefs:
   - group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
     kind: Gateway
     name: external
     namespace: api-gateway
 rules:
   - backendRefs:
       - group: ''
         kind: Service
         name: toystore
         port: 80
         weight: 1
     matches:
       - method: GET
         path:
           type: PathPrefix
           value: /toy
   - backendRefs:
       - group: ''
         kind: Service
         name: toystore
         port: 80
         weight: 1
     matches:
       - path:
           type: PathPrefix
           value: /admin
   - backendRefs:
       - group: ''
         kind: Service
         name: toystore
         port: 80
         weight: 1
     matches:
       - method: GET
         path:
           type: PathPrefix
           value: /test
EOF**
----
====
+
Substitute the <sandboxXXXX.opentlc.com> with the value as per your environment.
+
You should see the output as follows:
+
[subs="+quotes,+macros"]
----
httproute.gateway.networking.k8s.io/toystore created
----

* Confirm the **HTTPRoute** for your Gateway is created successfully:
+
====
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
**oc get httproute -n toystore**
----
====
+
You should see the output as follows:
+
[subs="+quotes,+macros"]
----
NAME       HOSTNAMES                                      AGE
toystore   ["toystore.managed.sandboxXXXX.opentlc.com"]   2m30s
----

* Now that the HTTP routes are successfully setup, proceed with implementing the policies on the routes.
