== Test the HTTP Routes

In this lab exercise, you will test access to various endpoints in the toystore application, which is secured by Connectivity Link policies.

* Test **/test** endpoint without APIKey:
+
====
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
**curl -k -w "%{http_code}" https://toystore.managed.<sandboxXXXX.opentlc.com>/test -i**
----
====
+
You receive output:
+
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
www-authenticate: APIKEY realm="api-key-authn"
x-ext-auth-reason: credential not found
date: Tue, 26 Nov 2024 17:48:49 GMT
server: istio-envoy
401
----
+
This response highlights that the Gateway is configured to enforce API key authentication,
rejecting requests that do not include a valid key.
To proceed successfully, you must provide the correct API key in the request headers.

* Test **/test** endpoint with invalid APIKey.
+
====
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
**curl  -H 'Authorization: APIKEY error' https://toystore.managed.sandboxXXXX.opentlc.com/toy -i**
----
====
+
You receive output:
+
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
HTTP/2 401
www-authenticate: APIKEY realm="api-key-authn"
x-ext-auth-reason: the API Key provided is invalid
date: Tue, 26 Nov 2024 17:55:37 GMT
server: istio-envoy
----
+
The output shows the server is rejecting the request because the API key provided is incorrect or invalid.

* Test **/toy** endpoint with valid APIKey for regular user.
+
====
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
**curl  -H 'Authorization: APIKEY iamaregularuser' https://toystore.managed.sandboxXXXX.opentlc.com/toy -i**
----
====
+
You receive output:
+
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
HTTP/2 200
content-type: application/json
server: istio-envoy
date: Mon, 26 Nov 2024 17:58:37 GMT
content-length: 1298
x-envoy-upstream-service-time: 1
{
  "method": "GET",
  "path": "/toy",
  "query_string": null,
  "body": "",
  "headers": { â€¦
  "uuid": "bf45b225-244f-41c8-abcd-36623f729858"
}
----
+
The request with the valid API key for a regular user was processed successfully, and the response contains the expected data in JSON format.

* Test **/admin/toy** endpoint as regular user.
+
====
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
**curl  -H 'Authorization: APIKEY iamaregularuser' https://toystore.managed.sandboxXXXX.opentlc.com/admin/toy -i**
----
====
+
You receive output:
+
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
HTTP/2 403
x-ext-auth-reason: Unauthorized
date: Mon, 25 Nov 2024 05:08:54 GMT
server: istio-envoy
----
+
Notice that the regular user accessing an **/admin** URL, is restricted with higher privileges (such as an admin), resulting in a 403 Forbidden error because the regular user does not have the necessary permissions.

* Test **/admin/toy** endpoint with valid APIKey for admin user.
+
====
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
**curl  -H 'Authorization: APIKEY iamanadmin' https://toystore.managed.sandboxXXXX.opentlc.com/admin/toy -i**
----
====
+
You receive output:
+
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
HTTP/2 200
content-type: application/json
server: istio-envoy
date: Mon, 25 Nov 2024 05:09:36 GMT
content-length: 1299
x-envoy-upstream-service-time: 1
{
  "method": "GET",
  "path": "/admin/toy",
  "query_string": null,
  "body": "",
  "headers": {..
  },
  "uuid": "cd459161-46c2-4099-a410-370027d1c070"
}
----
+
In this case, since the user provided a valid API key for an admin user, the server successfully processed the request to access the **/admin** URL and returned the expected response.
