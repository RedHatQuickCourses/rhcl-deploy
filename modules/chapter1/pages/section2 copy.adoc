= What Red Hat Connectivity Link Can Do?

* The following features are designed to work across multiple clusters as well as in a single-cluster environment:
** _Multicluster Ingress_: Connectivity Link uses DNS to route traffic to Gateways across clusters through a DNSPolicy.
** _Global Rate Limiting_: It supports global rate limiting by using shared Redis or Dragonfly stores based on RateLimitPolicy.
** _Global Authentication_: You can set up a unified AuthPolicy across clusters to ensure consistent API authentication and authorization.
** _Automatic TLS Certificates_:  You can configure a TLSPolicy to automatically provision TLS certificates based on Gateway listener hosts by using integration with cert-manager and ACME providers such as Letâ€™s Encrypt.
** _Federated Metrics Integration_: Connectivity Link provides dashboards and metrics for monitoring Gateways and traffic across multiple clusters.
