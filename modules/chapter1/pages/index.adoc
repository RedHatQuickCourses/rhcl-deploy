= Lab Scenario

== Situation

Globex Mobile, a fast-growing retail company, is expanding its mobile presence by allowing access to its core services via a new mobile app.
However, security is a top priority, as exposing their core service endpoints to unauthorized access could pose significant risks.

To address these concerns, _Globex Mobile_ has decided to:

* Implement OpenID Connect (OIDC) for secure authentication to the _Product Catalog API_.

Additionally, _Globex Mobile_ aims to protect its endpoints by:

* Implementing rate limiting
* Enforcing user-specific access controls

Their goals include:

* Managing everything through configuration
* Avoiding hardcoding
* Easily adjusting rate limits as needed

== Solution To The Situation Along With In-depth An Architecture

* _Globex Mobile’s_ development team has built a Mobile Gateway, serving as a single point of entry (a wrapper) in front of the company’s core services, following the gateway-pattern approach. This gateway allows Globex Mobile’s mobile app to access core services, but the endpoint must be secured for safe connectivity.

Focus on the Red Hat Connectivity Link (RHCL) portion of the diagram, which illustrates how RHCL is used to manage and secure the application connectivity.

Specifically, RHCL facilitates:

* **Gateway setup by the platform engineers**, which includes setting up below policies for secure connections to the backend services:

** TLS policies
** DNS policies
** RateLimit policies
** Auth policies

* **HTTPRoute creation by the developers**, which represents the service endpoints and allows them to:

** Override policies for authentication
** Rate limiting aligning with their specific needs

* **Separation of concerns between the platform engineers and developers**, allowing each to focus on their role in a scalable, secure multi-cluster environment.

== What We Will Do in This Lab-Oriented Course

* In the upcoming sections, we will exercise these concepts by dividing the work into three job roles:

.**Infrastructure Engineer**: Click to view what you would be doing as infrastructure engineer in this lab
[%collapsible]
====
As Infrastructure Engineer you will install, configure and deploy RHCL.

To achieve this a number of components need to be setup:

* A **Managed Zone** needs to be setup within the DNS provider. E.g. _managed.Globex Mobile.com_.
** Refer to the https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2024/06/12/getting-started-red-hat-connectivity-link-openshift[Getting started page] to learn how to setup a Managed Zone.
* Install cert-manager to manage TLS certificates for your Kuadrant gateways.
* Integrate Kuadrant with Istio as a Gateway API provider by installing and configuring Istio using the Sail Operator.
* Install the Kuadrant Operator and trigger the deployment of Kuadrant in Red Hat OpenShift cluster.

.**Platform Engineer**: Click to view what you would be doing as platform engineer in this lab
[%collapsible]
====
As Platform Engineer you will setup a Gateway which will allow for secure connection to the backend service endpoints.

To achieve this a number of components need to be setup:

* TLS issuer (a.k.a ClusterIssuer):
** Sets up a Certificate Issuer to create TLS certificates that are needed to secure communication.
** In this case, Globex Mobile uses https://letsencrypt.org/[Let’s Encrypt]. This certificate is stored as a secret to be referenced by the Gateways.
* https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/api-types/gateway/[Gateway]:
** Create a new Gateway (using the Gateway API and https://istio.io/latest/docs/[Istio]-based controllers) as an entrypoint for all requests to Globex Mobile’s system.
** The Gateway uses the TLS Certificates created by the TLS Issuer.
** Also a number of policies are setup to secure and protect the Gateway.
* https://docs.kuadrant.io/0.11.0/kuadrant-operator/doc/tls/[TLS Policy]:
** Leverages the TLS-issuer/CertificateIssuer to set up TLS certificates for the listeners defined within the Gateway.
** Listeners define the hostname for the various incoming requests and is denoted with a wildcard hostname based on the root domain.
** These gateways can use a subdomain of the Managed Zone. E.g. _*.managed.Globex Mobile.com_.
* https://docs.kuadrant.io/0.11.0/kuadrant-operator/doc/auth/[Auth Policy]:
** Setup a zero-trust deny-all policy that result in a default 403 response for any unprotected endpoints.
* https://docs.kuadrant.io/0.11.0/kuadrant-operator/doc/dns/[DNS Policy]:
** Provide DNS management by managing the lifecycle of DNS records to setup ingress connectivity using DNS to bring traffic to the Gateway.
* https://docs.kuadrant.io/0.11.0/kuadrant-operator/doc/rate-limiting/[RateLimit Policy]:
** Set up a default artificially low global limit to further protect any endpoints exposed by this Gateway.

.**Developer**: Click to view what you would be doing as developer in this lab

====
With the Gateway available, developers can onboard service endpoints by creating an HTTPRoute for each. They can also override Auth and RateLimit policies set by the Platform Engineer to meet their specific auth/authz and rate limiting needs.

* https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/api-types/httproute/[HTTPRoute]:
** This is part of the Gateway API.
** Set up an HTTPRoute by linking it to the parent Gateway configured by the Platform Engineer.
** Define a hostname to route requests correctly and set up rules to direct traffic to the appropriate backend endpoint.

* AuthPolicy:
** Globex Mobile uses OIDC for authentication.
** As a developer you creates a policy on the HTTPRoute, overriding the Platform Engineer's deny-all policy.

* RateLimit Policy:
** The default low-limit rate policy at the Gateway level is overridden by this policy to meet specific needs.
** Adjustments can easily be made through this policy.
